# FixedStabilizer

This app is intended to help create cinemagraphs without a tripod. Recording a scene by hand will always incur some level of instability. This app tracks the optical flow of the video and sets the best fixed points to provide 'tripod like' stabliization. 

Examples of fixed stabliized hand held recordings are here: https://flixel.com/george2222/
